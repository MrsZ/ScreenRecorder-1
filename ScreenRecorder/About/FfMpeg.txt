Legal status of codecs
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

FFmpeg contains more than 100 codecs, most of which do not just store uncompressed data. Most codecs 
that compress information could be claimed by patent holders. Such claims may be enforceable in 
countries like the United States which have implemented software patents, but are considered 
unenforceable or void in countries that have not implemented software patents. Furthermore, 
many of these codecs are only released under terms that forbid reverse engineering, even for 
purposes of interoperability. These terms of use are forbidden in certain countries. 

For example, some European Union nations have not implemented software patents and have laws expressly 
allowing reverse engineering for purposes of interoperability.
